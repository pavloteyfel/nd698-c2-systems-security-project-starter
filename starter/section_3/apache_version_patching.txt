#Provide the apache version and configuration lines to be changed 
I chekced the apache version with `apache2 -v` command
In the /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf file we need to change 2 configuration parameters to hide version number and Os information.
The ServerTokens directive controls whether Server response header field which is sent back to clients includes the generic OS details.
The ServerSignature configures the footer on server-generated documents. 

# Apache Version
Server version: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
Server built:   Apr  3 2019 18:04:59

# Configuration file change(Hint: the change has to be made in /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf)
1.) Set the following parameters in the security.conf file:
ServerTokens Prod
ServerSignature Off
