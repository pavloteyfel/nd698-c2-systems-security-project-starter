# Provide the backdoor entries created by the nation state attackers. 
From OSSEC it can be seen that the ubuntu user after a multiple unsuccessful login attempts has successfully
logged in, changed UID to root and created a new user named "darklord".

With `netstat -antp` I found a suspicious port listening > 0.0.0.0:56565 
Among the running processes I saw the /tmp/remotesec -k -l 56565 process that was started by the root user.
Also found this login row in auth.log: 
Sep 21 22:25:04 ubuntu-VirtualBox sudo:   ubuntu : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/tmp/ssh-Q5lxMMDFckma ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/find . /home/ubuntu/ remotesec

# Rouge Username
darklord

# Backdoor process name
/tmp/remotesec

# Backdoor port number the above process is listening on
56565
